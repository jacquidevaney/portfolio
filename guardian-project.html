					<h1>The Guardian US + Studio 20:
					<br> Reaching Millennials</h1>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			During the Spring of 2015, I worked on a project with The Guardian US on how to better engage the millennial generation. 
			<h3>Part 1: Shareable Tech Coverage</h3>
			I first aided their <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us/technology" class="links" target="_blank">technology vertical</a> on creating a social strategy for Twitter and Facebook that was millennial friendly. I started with a question: what makes some tech stories more shareable than others? I conducted research on strategies competitors use, like Mashable or The Verge, and I analyzed the elements that went into a few popular posts. After doing A/B headline testing, I found that using conversational language is key - millennials like to be talked <i>to</i>, not at. I also found that visual diversity, like having photos and videos, often drives social shares. In addition, explainer and how-to content often resonates well with millennials. 
			<h3>Part 2: Getting Started on Vine</h3>
			 I also worked with their video editor, Christian Bennett, on how to utilize Vine to connect with a younger audience and create a community on mobile. I looked at a few ways <a href="http://studio20vine.blogspot.com/2015/03/blog-post.html" class="links" target="_blank">other news companies</a> used Vine and how those strategies could inform creating one for the Guardian US. I found that the Guardian US shoudl focus on brand awareness, not traffic. Since Vine doesn't allow hyperlinks, it's best to provide easy ways to discover more - like, "visit us on YouTube for the full video" or post a simple URL that can be easily retyped. I also found that hashtags on Vine are important for discovering content, like they are on Twitter and Instagram. Also - it's best to post on Vine once a day or every other day.<br>

			 <h3>Conclusions</h3>
			 In order to engage millennials, <strong>first</strong> meet them where they are. And, that doesn't always mean just Facebook. Other platforms may not drive as much traffic, but often have loyal users that go to that site for certain topics. For example, Tumblr and YouTube are huge for TV fans. Vine is big for comedy and animation. <strong>Second</strong>, use personality. In the research conducted, I found that using most popular social media posts are conversational, even playful, in tone. <strong>Third</strong>, images are essential because they build a better user experience on social and importantly - on mobile. It's a way catch users attention and keep them engaged in content. <strong>Fourth</strong>, create and use templates to make experiments simple and reproducible - it means it's not necessary to start from scratch everytime.
			<h3>Tools Used</h3>
			For the A/B testing, I created a survey using Google Forms and did a call out on social media (since many of the people I'm connected with are millennials). For Vine, I created a few sample Vines directly through the Vine app. For the final presentation to the Guardian, I helped create an introduction video and used Adobe After Effects to create some text animations and Adobe Premiere Pro to edit video and audio.
