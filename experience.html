						The Wall Street Journal - Graduate Thesis Project
					</li>
					<li>
						September 2015 - December 2015
					</li>
					<li class="light">

						My thesis project centers around creating context and background for the news using a tool I created named <a href="http://jacquidevaney.github.io/wsjtheranos/" class="links" target="_blank">Accordion</a>.
						<span class="accordion-toggle"><span class="click">see more +</span></span>
						<div class="accordion-content default">
						 What I've found is that many readers can get lost in the complex, ever evolving news cycle and gaining valuable background is arduous, from having to go back and read a laundry list of old articles to googling until you give up. I hypothesized that there is a way for news companies to give the value of background to a user right in an article. And thus, <a href="http://jacquidevaney.github.io/wsjtheranos/" class="links" target="_blank">Accordion</a> was born. It's an in-line tool that expands and collapses with extra info for readers to digest while reading a story. The idea is that the background is there when they need it, without having to leave the page or search on their own.

						I wrote blog posts, edited audio, interviewed guests, pitched ideas, researched leads and even produced a few of my own stories. This is my <a href="http://www.texasstandard.org/shows/07292015/the-unbelievable-true-stories-of-longhorn-cavern/" class="links" target="_blank">favorite one.</a>

						January 2015 - May 2015

					<li class="light">
						During the Spring of 2015, I worked on a project with The Guardian US on how to better engage the millennial generation. 
						<span class="accordion-toggle"><span class="click"> see more +</span></span>
						<div class="accordion-content default">
						I first aided their technology vertical on creating a social strategy for Twitter and Facebook that was millennial friendly. I conducted research on the best language for engagement, photos and video and competitor strategy. I also worked with their video editor on how to utilize Vine to connect with a younger audience and create a community on mobile.

						<div class="accordion-content default">
						We produced a 25 page report full of expert and employee interviews. We found out a lot of stuff and recommended a few things, like how important it is for everyone to be on the same sharing tool (like Slack) and to find ways to release from the "hamster wheel."

						It was at SMORG that I began to understand the importance of storytelling, not only editorially, but also as a tool for building culture. One of the most important lessons I learned is to make each detail count, because, it is the little things that keep people going. I was also introduced to the Agile method here - collaboration is key (and trello is good, too). 
						<br>
						When I was promoted to Events Admin, I learned how to negotiate contracts, how to plan event logistics, special project management and event attendee management.
